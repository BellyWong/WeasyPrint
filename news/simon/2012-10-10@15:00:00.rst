WeasyPrint 0.15: More API, more docs, more fixes
------------------------------------------------

0.15 is (finally!) out. This one is light in CSS features, but `Sphinx-based
documentation </docs/>`_ as well as a new API with low-level access to
individual pages.

**Backward-incompatible change**: the ``HTML.get_png_pages()`` method is gone,
it was ridiculously specific compared to the new API. It can be reproduced
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_png_pages(document):
        """Yield (png_bytes, width, height) tuples."""
        for page in document.pages:
            yield document.copy([page]).write_png()

`Changelog for 0.15 </docs/changelog/#version-0-15>`_.
